# client-tools-examples
This is my list of project examples that use my own module ```client-tools``` to build.

## Overview
This project is built using React's official starter kit `create-react-app`.
However, since the contained module `react-script` (which compiles and builds the site using webpack and other things...) is rather big (~80Mb), it is being removed and need to be installed globally - `npm install -g react-script`.

<b>Therefore please install `react-script` before running `npm install`, `npm start` or `npm run build`</b>.

# Demo
To test and start off the demo, run `npm install`, and then run `npm start`.
